4. rebalances when the right child and right-right grandchild are both red (left child is black)
   after rebalancing, shift color of parent and right child
   simply shift down blackness when both child is red

5. AVL tree considers the height of left/right children for rebalancing (while unwinding recursion)
   if heights differ by more than 1, then rebalance
   AVL trees are faster than redâ€“black trees because they are more strictly balanced.
   red-black trees only need 1-bit storage (red or black), while AVL trees need more storage
