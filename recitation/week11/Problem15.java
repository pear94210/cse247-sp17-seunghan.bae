	 * -

	 * 2. Given a graph, and a depth first numbering of that graph, how can you determine
	 *    whether an edge is a cross-edge, back-edge, tree-edge, chord-edge with regard to
	 *    that depth-first numbering?
	 * - tree: first (from low to high), second (from high to low)
	 * - cross: from high to low, in a different sub-tree
	 * - back: first (from high to low), second (from low to high), in the same sub-tree
	 * - chord: usually exists within a cycle, connecting two non-adjacent vertices
