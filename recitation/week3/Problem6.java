	 * The statements below show some features of "Big-O" notation for the
	 * functions f = f(n) and g = g(n). Determine whether each statement is
	 * TRUE of FALSE and correct the formula in the latter case.
	 * 
	 * (a) Rule of sums: O(f + g) = O(f) + O(g)
	 *     => TRUE
	 * 
	 * (b) Rule of products: O(f*g) = O(f) * O(g)
	 *     => TRUE
	 * 
	 * (c) Transitivity: if g = O(f) and h = O(f) then g = O(h)
	 *     => FALSE: if g = O(f) & f = O(h), then g = O(h)
	 * 
	 * (d) 5n + 8n^2 + 100n^3 = O(n^4)
	 *     => TRUE
	 * 
	 * (e) 5n + 8n^2 + 100n^3 = O((n^2)log(n))
	 *     => FALSE: O(n^3)
