	 * Problem 32.2-2
	 * 
	 * How would you extend the Rabin-Karp method to the problem of searching a text string
	 * for an occurrence of any one of a given set of k patterns? Start by assuming that all
	 * k patterns have the same length. Then generalize your solution to allow the patterns
	 * to have different lengths.
	 * 
	 * - same length: run the program just like you would run it with only 1 pattern,
	 *   assuming that different patterns have different hashes, check every window
	 *   to see if the hash matches any of the patterns
	 * - different length: since the window length is not fixed, we might need to run
	 *   the program with different window length and check for hash matches.
